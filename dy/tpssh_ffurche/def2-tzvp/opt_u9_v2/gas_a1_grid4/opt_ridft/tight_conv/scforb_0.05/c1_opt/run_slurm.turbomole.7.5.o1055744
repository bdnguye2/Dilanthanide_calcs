ERROR: your energy calculation did not converge !!
       Possible reasons:
       - not enough iterations: increase the max. number of SCF iterations
         i.e. $scfiterlimit
         and check your occupation.
       - because of wrong input like starting an RI calculation
         without having switched on RI 
       - missing input (basis set, auxiliary basis set, MOs, ..) 
    Check job.last and job.<number> for more detailed error output
