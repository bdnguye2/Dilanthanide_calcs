# Dilanthanide Calculations for 1-Y, 1-Tb, 1-Ga, and 1-Dy

We report the synthesis and characterization of the trinuclear 4d–4f compounds
 [Co(C5Me5)2][(C5Me5)2Ln(μ-S)2Mo(μ-S)2Ln(C5Me5)2], 1-Ln (Ln = Y, Gd, Tb, Dy),
 containing the highly polarizable MoS43– bridging unit. UV–Vis–NIR diffuse 
reflectance spectra and DFT calculations of 1-Ln reveal a low-energy metal-to-metal 
charge transfer transition assigned to charge transfer from the singly occupied 4dz2 
orbital of MoV to the empty 5d orbitals of the lanthanides (4d in the case of 1-Y), 
mediated by sulfur-based 3p orbitals. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra collected 
for 1-Y in a tetrahydrofuran solution show large 89Y hyperfine coupling constants of 
A⊥ = 23 MHz and A|| = 26 MHz, indicating the presence of significant yttrium-localized 
unpaired electron density. Magnetic susceptibility data support similar electron 
delocalization and ferromagnetic Ln–Mo exchange for 1-Gd, 1-Tb, and 1-Dy. This 
ferromagnetic exchange gives rise to an S = 15/2 ground state for 1-Gd and one of 
the largest magnetic exchange constants involving GdIII observed to date, with 
JGd–Mo = +16.1(2) cm–1. Additional characterization of 1-Tb and 1-Dy by ac magnetic 
susceptibility measurements reveals that both compounds exhibit slow magnetic 
relaxation. Although a Raman magnetic relaxation process is dominant for both 1-Tb 
and 1-Dy, an extracted thermal relaxation barrier of Ueff = 68 cm–1 for 1-Dy is 
the largest yet reported for a complex containing a paramagnetic 4d metal center. 
Together, these results provide a potentially generalizable route to enhanced nd–4f 
magnetic exchange, revealing opportunities for the design of n
